    <p>The Meta Quest 2 (formerly known as Oculus Quest 2)
       is the best VR headset to buy for<br> most people.
       It offers the most versatility and the best value in the most affordable package<br>
       available.

    <a href="valve.html"> <h3>Valve Index</h3></a>
    <p>The Valve Index is an old dog in this market, but Valve's first, and so far only, VR headset<br>
       remains one of the best that money can buy today. Unfortunately, in terms of resolution, the<br>
       Index is lagging behind the rest of the market. The headset boasts dual 1440 x 1600 LCD<br>
       panels for crisp but not mind-blowing image clarity. The variable refresh rate settings allow<br>
       you to dial in displays to match your PC's performance, which is an incredible help when you<br>
       have a less-powerful graphics card in your system. The Index supports 80, 90, 120, and 144<br>
       Hz configurations.</p>

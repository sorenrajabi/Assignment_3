    <h2>Quest 2</h2>
    <p>The Meta <b>Quest 2</b> (formly known as Oculus<b>Quest 2</b>)is the best VR headset to buy for<br>
    most people. It offers the most versatility and the best value in the most affordable package<br>
    available.
    </p>
    <p>As mentioned above, the <b>Quest 2</b> is powered a Qualcomm SnapDragon XR-2 SoC,a<br>
    processor and graghics chip derived from the company's flagship smartphone processors but<br>
    optimized for VR and AR capabilities. The <b>Quest 2</b> is a self-contained device that does not<br>
    tether or a Wi-Ficonnection, giving you the best of both worlds.  
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Quest 2</b> offers a high-resolution VR experience without the need for a computer. The headset<br>
        provide 1832 x 1920
        pixels per eye, a higher resolution than the Valve Index and HTC Vive<br>
        Cosmos tethered PC headset.<b>Quest 2</b> also offers variable refresh rate, with developer able<br>
        to targer 60hz, 90hz, and 120hz configurations depending on the performence demands of<br> 
        the games.
        </b> 
        <p>
            Meta <b>Quest 2</b> is currently available in a 128GB entry model and a larger 256GB model.The<br>
            original 64GB edition is no longer sold. If you finde one the shelf, we recommended leaving<br>
            it unless it is an outstanding deal. Some of the newest <b>Quest 2 </b> games barely fit on the smaller<br>
            cover for better hygiene.

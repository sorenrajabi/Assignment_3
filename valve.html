    <h2>Valve Index</h2>
    <p>The Valve Index is an old dog in this market, but Valve's first, and so far only, VR headset<br>
       remains one of the best that money can buy today. Unfortunately, in terms of resolution, the<br>
       Index is lagging behind the rest of the market. The headset boasts dual 1440 x 1600 LCD<br>
       panels for crisp but not mind-blowing image clarity. The variable refresh rate settings allow<br>
       you to dial in displays to match your PC's performance, which is an incredible help when you<br>
       have a less-powerful graphics card in your system. The Index supports 80, 90, 120, and 144<br>
       Hz configurations.
    </p>
    The best part of the Index is the versatility of its tracking system. The Index headset uses the<br>
    SteamVR tracking system, first introduced on the original HTC Vive and improved for the<br>
    Vive Pro. The Lighthouse IR tracking system is still the most accurate tracking system for<br>
    home-based VR systems, especially if you have a set of SteamVR 2.0 based stations. In<br>
    addition, the SteamVR tracking system is compatible with many accessories, including the<br>
    Valve Index controllers (colloquially known as Knuckles controllers), Vive Trackers, and the<br>
    recently Kickstarter-funded Tundra Trackers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Valve offers the Index as a solo HMD, which you can use to upgrade an existing SteamVR<br>
        system, such as an old Vive system. You can also get the Valve Index controllers alone or<br>
        bundle them with a headset. The best value for VR newcomers is the complete kit, including<br>
        the headset, two controllers, two 2.0 base stations, and wall mounting hardware.
